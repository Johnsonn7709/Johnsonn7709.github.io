      <p>The Giza Pyramid Complex is the location of three pyramid complexes known as the Great Pyramids.  
	  This is also the location of the Great Sphinx of Giza. The pyramids have been seen as common symbols of 
	  ancient Egypt and were popularized in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was 
	  listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. 
	  It is by far the oldest of the ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.</p>

	  <p>The Abu Simbel temples are two massive rock temples.  The complex is part of the UNESCO 
	  World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments".  The twin temples were originally carved out of 
	  the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II.
	  Their huge external rock relief figures have become iconic.</p>
