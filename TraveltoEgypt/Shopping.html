      <h4>Looking for Food?</h4>
      <p>The food in Egypt is a taste you will want to experience.  
	  Popular dishes include Koshary, Ful Mudammas, Fiteer Baladi, and many more foreign delicacies.  
	  Whether you're in the streets of a market or in a shopping center, there will always be a restaurant nearby. 
	  Try <a href="http://kosharyaboutarek.food-ts.com/">Koshary Abou Tarek in Cairo.</a></p><br><br><br>
	  <h4>Looking for Authentic Souvenirs?</h4>
	  <p>You will not find an authentic item at any street market in Egypt. 
	  Peddlers will only have items that are made to look expensive but will most likely be unauthentic and cheap. 
	  Look for established detailers and retailers who can guarantee the authenticity of the product you’re about to buy. 
	  You might still be able to haggle, and you’ll know you’re walking away with the real deal.</p>

      <h4>Looking for Open-Air Markets?</h4>
      <p>The famous market is Khan El Khalili in Cairo’s Islamic district, which is one of the 
	  oldest bazaars in Egypt, and you’ll be presented with many choices of where to go, what to buy, and bargaining. 
	  The labyrinth of streets is lined with stalls and restaurants, most offering the same things, 
	  and most manned by overly friendly salespeople who’ll do whatever it takes to hold your attention 
	  and close a sale.</p><br>
	  <h4>Looking for Shopping Centers?</h4>
	  <p>There are malls in all of the major cities like Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor.  
	  They're complex shopping centers not much different from malls in America.  They mainly attract tourists
	  and hold many shops for things typical in a mall.  Many malls also include a cinema.  Try <a href="http://www.mallofegypt.com/">The Mall of Egypt.</a></p>
