      <h2>Train</h2>
      <p>The railways cover limited network from Cairo to Alexandria, the Delta and the Canal Zone, along the coast to Marsa Matrouh and 
	  up the Nile Valley to Luxor and Aswan. Egypt’s air-conditioned trains provide comfort for the long haul.  
	  The most comfortable option is first class which includes waiter service, reclining armchairs and on-board movies. You can reserve seats
	  up to seven days in advance. If you’re looking for absolute luxury, then opt for the more expensive sleeper cars. 
	  Passengers get a comfortable two-bed cabin with a sink, plus breakfast and dinner, and access to a dining car and bar.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Vehicle Transportation</h2>
	  <p>The three main bus companies are located in Cairo and have routes that branch out through the country.  
	  There are also smaller independent bus companies scattered across the country.  Service Taxis are best for short distances.
	  They're cheaper and faster than the train or bus, but the ride can be hectic.  Streets in Egypt can be very chaotic.  Because of this, 
	  renting a car in Egypt is not for the faint-hearted.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>On Foot</h2>
	  <p>In the smaller locales, travelling on foot will be the best option.  When you're in the heart of a city, everything can be reached on foot.
	  Travel times will depend on the time of day and how busy the streets are.</p>
